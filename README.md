# 100-Days-Of-Code_Day-1_Band-Name-Generator
 100 days of code Day 1
Following Dr. Yu's 100 Days of Code! 

This project will be a simple 'band name generator.' Going to get those Python Muscles moving again.

This program will help you generate a band name by asking questions! 

To Run:
python app.py

And answer the questions to get your band name! 

I'm also participating in a month of Linux. Creating this on an OpenSUSE system!
